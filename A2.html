                <p>This visualization serves as a gateway into the data, providing a visual representation of the depth and breadth of Metro Boston’s municipal zoning and land use. This bar chart visualizes the percent of residential land in a particular municipality that has been zoned exclusively for single-family homes (% SFZ). Organized in descending order, the chart shows a notable difference between roughly half of the 101 communities: a little over half of the municipalities zone some proportion of their residential land for Single Family use, while the other half zones none of their residential land zoned for Single-family use.</p>

        <h2>Summary </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Upzoning efforts within the Metropolitan Boston area must grapple with the economic, racial, historical, and spatial diversity confronting the 101 municipalities of the region. In this exploratory analysis, some of the areas with the greatest potential for upzoning and diverse housing typologies were visualized. A look into the demographic profile of Metropolitan Boston, and the amount of land that has been allocated to Single-Family Zoning provided helpful insights into how exclusionary zoning has negatively impacted the lived reality of many today. More specifically, in areas with the highest percentage of Single-Family Zoning, income and racial disparities were highest, presenting a strong correlation between SFZ and demographic homogeneity; likewise, areas that permitted other housing typologies correlated with more diverse household incomes and higher proportions of the community that were non-white. Spatial insights also emerged from this analysis. Many suburban and urban communities with Single Family Zoning have existing, non-conforming housing typologies.These apparently “illegal” structures may provide useful precedents for upzoning initiatives, particularly in extant communities where other housing typologies represent a small share of the total residential area.</p> 
        <p>Further spatial analysis is needed to confirm many of the relationships drawn from this initial analysis. In addition to a closer look at the historical trend of these municipalities, and how they might have changed over time in response to watershed planning/policy interventions, additional analysis on more data—such as housing classification, assessed value, and date of construction—needs to be done. This project did not visualize household size for families (nor non-families), so the next phase of research would explore housing density across Metropolitan Boston using household sizes as the key variable. Incorporating these and other data into the project, new questions regarding zoning, housing availability, density, and demography would help highlight the historical effects of exclusionary zoning and the potential areas of consideration for upzoning.</p>
